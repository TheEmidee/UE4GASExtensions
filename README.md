# UE4 GAS Extensions

This plug-in is a collection of abilities, tasks, and other things to expand upon the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) of Unreal.

The initial work comes from the [GASShooter repository](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter). \
Other improvements were added from the [Lyra sample game](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/).

This plugin depends upon some plugins I created and you can find on my github page : https://github.com/TheEmidee/.
